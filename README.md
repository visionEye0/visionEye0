# Hi there 👋 I'm Pranav Krishna

software Developer with 3.5 years of experience in frontend and full-stack development.
Started my career at DCKAP as a Frontend Developer, where I built responsive, user-friendly web interfaces for international clients and proactively identified and resolved critical security vulnerabilities, including XSS and HTML injection. Later, at Jardian Inc., I worked as the sole Full-Stack Developer, designing and delivering AIpublisher.org, a journal publishing platform. I engineered the frontend with React.js, backend with Node.js/Express.js, and integrated a MySQL database. Additionally, I implemented peer-review workflows, developed a secure payment system, and created an admin back-office portal for content and user management. My journey into tech started in 2022, and since then, I’ve taken on roles that challenged and inspired me to grow continuously.
