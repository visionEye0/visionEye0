# Hi there 👋 I'm Pranav Krishna

I'm a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in front-end development, an interest in cybersecurity, and a growing curiosity about trading algorithms and blockchain technologies. My journey into tech started in 2021, and since then, I’ve taken on roles that challenged and inspired me to grow continuously.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🧑‍🎓 I began my career in 2021 during my final year of BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications).
- 💻 My first project was with **Jardyan Inc**, where I built a full-fledged **journal publishing platform** with CRUD functionality and a payment system — all from scratch.
- 🏢 Joined **DCKAP** in March 2022 as a **Front-End Developer**, where I turned designer mockups into functional UI with production-ready code.
- 🔐 Transitioned into a **Blockchain Developer** for the last 1.5 year at DCKAP.
- 🧪 After resigning in April 2025, I’ve been deep-diving into **crypto trading** and **blockchain** protocols.
- 💹 Built and tested my own **trading bots/strategies** using the Binance API.
- 📜 Explored DeFi protocols including DEXs, lending/borrowing, staking, and flashloans.
- 📚 I completed my college coursework but didn’t officially graduate due to one pending subject.
